# Sprint Retrospective

## 12/3/23-6:00

Participants: Tyler, Chris, Gabriel, Brendan, Iris

Most of the work assigned by Tyler, Chris, and Gabriel was completed. The code that was pushed to dev is ready for merge to main.
Realized US#3 was too simple and we wanted to make sure our tasks's difficulty was on par per requirements so we decided we are going 
to create a new US and hope to complete our last 3 US in our sprint 3.
